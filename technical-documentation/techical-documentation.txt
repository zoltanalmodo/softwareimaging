Zoltan Almodo - Software Imaging - cubic Bezier curve.


Task / Problem:
Write a program that calculates the points on a cubic Bezier curve,
given four control points and the number of intervals.

Requirements:
Take as input 4 control points and the number of intervals.
Generate as output cubic Bezier points for values of t between 0 and 1
(0 and 1 included) using the input parameters.

Breaking down the problem.
1-> understanding bezier curves:

"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/nerding-out-with-bezier-curves-6e3c0bc48e2f/"
"https://javascript.info/bezier-curve"

2-> finding useable code:
Because I had to create an input for segments "intervals" i could not use
the canvas bezierCurveTo() method.

>>>
var c = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
var ctx = c.getContext("2d");
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(20, 20);
ctx.bezierCurveTo(20, 100, 200, 100, 200, 20);
ctx.stroke();
<<<

I found this on stackoverflow:

3-> drawing on canvas in React
How to draw on canvas in React.js
HTML5 <canvas> element is a DOM element react avoids touching the DOM
To draw on the canvas we need to get a context with wich we draw.
And we need to call ctx on the canvas element itself to draw.

4-> Building the form using Reactstrap:
Looked a god choice as it manages the state, I can add initial values
and it handles updates as well.

5-> conecting form and values with state and control point Calculation.
